Naming convention

Variables
=========


Use camelCase.


Channels
========


Use camelCase and add the suffixe `Ch`, for example ``fastqFilesCh``.


Files
=====


Use camelCase.

For the scripts you develop and that are accessible in the ``bin/`` use the prefix **ap** (**a**\nalysis **p**\ipeline). This prefix makes it possible to distinguish the scripts you personnally developed from those you retrieved from third parties.


Environment variables
=====================

Use snake_case and lower case.
