Naming convention
*****************


For variables and file names, use camelCase.

For the scripts you develop and that are accessible in the ``bin/`` use the prefix ap (analysis pipeline). This prefix makes it possible to distinguish the scripts you personnally developed from those you retrieved from third parties.
