# TODO: if we want to use find_namespace or find function recommended by setuptools,
# we should include all packages and data files like cmake and install folder inside src folder.
# Otherwise we have to do it manually with packages and packages_dir as it has be done below
# NB: until cmake files are not inside src folder, it's not recommended to install the
# package in editable mode with pip since cmake and py files are not in the same repository
# Basically it will break any importlib.resources access relying on cmake/install folders
# and return invalid paths using the IDE debugger. You will need to symlink those folders in src.
# This is why cmake and install are symlinked in the src folder
